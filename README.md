# watchify-request [![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Wraps a [watchify](http://github.com/substack/watchify) instance into an HTTP
request handler, performing the minimal amount of rebundling required and
pausing requests mid-build to avoid getting old versions of your script on
reload.

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/watchify-request.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/watchify-request/)

### `handler = watchifyRequest(bundler)`

Creates a request handler out of a `watchify` or `browserify` instance.

### `handler(req, res[, done])`

Handles the request, where `req` is an `HTTPRequest` instance and `res` is its
matching `HTTPResponse` instance. `done(err, body)` is optional, and called if
you want to add a custom error handler or manipulate the request after
`browserify` is done.
